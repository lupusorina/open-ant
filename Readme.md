## Hardware.

The hardware is designed to be easy to build and use:
- single computer operation via USB, Python only, minimal dependencies (no embedded firmware / OS, networking, ROS...)
- no battery: continuous operation with wall adapter
- all COTS parts + 3D printed parts
- no soldering required
- no special tools required (only the standard hex drivers for M2, M2.5, and M3 screws which are 1.5mm, 2.0mm, and 2.5mm, respectively)

We recommend adding a heat sink to the knee actuators, for example this [one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HLZWKYN?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1)



### Dynamixel Setup (before assembling the robot!)

The Dynamixels should be configured to 1Mbaud and have their IDs changed to the following:

| Motor Position      | Motor ID |
|---------------------|----------|
| Rear Right Hip      |   10     |
| Rear Right Knee     |   11     |
| Front Right Hip     |   20     |
| Front Right Knee    |   21     |
| Front Left Hip      |   30     |
| Front Left Knee     |   31     |
| Rear Left Hip       |   40     |
| Rear Left Knee      |   41     |

Use the following script to change the IDs of the motors, connecting one at a time.
```
python3 embodied_ant_env/dynamixel_change_id.py /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXX <NEW_ID> 57600
```

When done, the following command will change the baudrate of all connected motors on the port to 1Mbaud.
```
python3 embodied_ant_env/dynamixel_change_baud.py /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXX 1000000
```

## Software Setup

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies. (python >= 3.10)
```
python3.12 -m venv ant_env
source ant_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create a new config file, run:
```
python3 embodied_ant_env/make_ant_config.py /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXXXX <APRIL_TAG_ID>
```
which will create a new config file `ant<APRIL_TAG_ID>.json` in the current directory.

Next, edit the config file to specify imu port, camera id and fov.


### Possible signals

- Joint position
- Joint velocity
- Body angular rate
- Inertial up in body
- Commanded velocity in x and y

For reward: position of the body in x and y, and the angle of the body.


## Run the simulation

```
cd sim
python3 ant_mujoco.py
```

## Run SAC

for simulation:
```
cd agents/sac/
./run.sh sim
```

for hardware:
```
cd agents/sac/
./run.sh hw
```

## Run SARSA

for simulation:
```
cd agents/sarsa/
./run.sh sim
```

for hardware:
```
cd agents/sarsa/
./run.sh hw
```

## Hyperparameter tuning

Optuna-based tuning of the MPO variants

MPO:
```bash
python3 -m tuning.runner --entry agents.mpo.tune_mpo_acme --name mpo_search --storage-dir runs/tuning --workers 8 --n-trials 512
```

MPO ensemble:
```bash
python3 -m tuning.runner --entry agents.mpo.tune_mpo_acme_ensemble --name mpo_ensemble_search --storage-dir runs/tuning --workers 8 --n-trials 512
```

DMPO:
```bash
python3 -m tuning.runner --entry agents.dmpo.tune_dmpo_acme --name dmpo_search --storage-dir runs/tuning --workers 8 --n-trials 512
```

ANYxMPO (all three variants in one study ~ should find the best algorithm and its hyperparameters):
```bash
python3 -m tuning.runner --entry agents.tune_mpo_any --name mpo_any_search --storage-dir runs/tuning --workers 8 --n-trials 1024
```

Monitor the tuning progress with the optuna-dashboard:
```bash
optuna-dashboard runs/tuning/*_search.journal
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: The position of the ant flickers. What should I do?

The fiducial system is designed to be quite robust. If you encounter problems, make sure the markers are clearly visible and the camera exposure is configured properly (you can adjust exposure using LogiTune). 
Here are some suggestions:
* Depending on your environment, you may need to disable auto-exposure for more consistent detection.
* For the best performance, you should have the camera looking down at the playground.
* The origin marker should be mounted flat. Any warping can cause issues.
* Make sure to plot all system inputs and outputs to verify that the signals are clean. Learning from noisy or faulty signals can lead to poor results.

### Q: What’s the recommended way to specify a /dev/ device path in a JSON file on Ubuntu?

Use the persistent device path, for example:
```
/dev/serial/by-id/YYY
```

### Q: Will the screws become loose over time due to vibrations?

Yes, it can happen. For this, it is recommended to use Loctite Threadlocker. Ensure you don't apply too much because it can leak under the motor head and cause clogging.

### Q: How can we increase the friction on the lower legs?

We recommend 3D printing socks out of TPU.

### Q: There might be intermittent communication dropout. How is this addressed?

During long duration run-time learning experiments, we observed intermittent, very short communication dropouts. 
The power connection was modified to connect directly to the screw terminals on the control board rather than using the barrel connector. This eliminated the voltage drops caused by vibration-induced intermittent contact during learning experiments.
